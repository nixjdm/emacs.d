# README

This is meant to be a drop-in replacement for my `~/.emacs.d` dir, so emacs will pick up my custom settings right off the bat. This repo is fast and dirty and works for me. YMMV for different envs. I'm running the [daily snapshot of emacs](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-elisp/+archive/ubuntu/ppa), so parts of this might not work with older versions of emacs.

So to try it out (and blow away your own custom settings):
```
rm -rf ~/.emacs.d
git clone git@github.com:nixjdm/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
```
